# Tasks
[ ] grep for nws (case insensitve) and also for 'Needleman' (case insensitive). The nws algorithm is a local variant of needleman wunsch, but biologists will be familiar with it as Smith Waterman, so nws needs to become sw, and all  such naming updated throughout the project, including in comments, file names, directory names, function names. When the task is completed there should be no needleman or wunsch or nws in the repo.
[ ] All html files should have a favicon of wheel.ico 
[ ] All styles should be moved into style.css
[ ] All .py files should have command line arguments using argparse. If there isn't an obvious action for the file, for example in the case of a library, there should be a --test option which can be a stub.
[ ] Every program, .py or .mm or .cpp or config_*.html that provides settings should be documented in /docs, showing the settings and defaults.
