# Tasks
[ ] All html files should have a favicon of wheel.ico 
[ ] All styles should be moved into style.css
[ ] All .py files should have command line arguments using argparse. If there isn't an obvious action for the file, for example in the case of a library, there should be a --test option which can be a stub.
[ ] Every program, .py or .mm or .cpp or config_*.html that provides settings should be documented in /docs, showing the settings and defaults.
