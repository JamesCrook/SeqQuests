# All-On-All comparison of your own protein data

This feature actually isn't available yet. I need to work on 'prep' of databases, so you can provide your own sequences in place of swissprot. Also database vs database rather than just all-on-all for one database.


# Uniprot 

An all-on-all comparison generates 228,127,478 links that are above the 110 threshold, and this reduces to 6,462,988 after tree reduction.
