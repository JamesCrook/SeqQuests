# All-On-All comparison of your own protein data

This feature actually isn't available yet. I need to work on 'prep' of databases, so you can provide your own sequences in place of swissprot. Also database vs database rather than just all-on-all for one database.


# Uniprot 

An all-on-all comparison generates 228,127,478 links that are above the 110 threshold. The tree builder reports adding 6,462,988 links, because it never adds a link weaker than one already present. The eventual tree produced before additional filtering has 572,055 links. After filters such as 'same name', 'uncharacterised' and 'same family', we get 6,579 general finds and 4,207 with biased composition.
