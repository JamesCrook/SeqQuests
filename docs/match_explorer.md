# Match Explorer UI
match_explorer.html provides a web based interface for browsing sequence hits files featuring pairs of proteins, such as sw_finds.txt

Here is an example of one such reported similar pair.

```
84284-79318 s(299) B1HPV0-Q72H22 Length: 307/608
 84284: Heme A synthase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01664}; Lysinibacillus sphaericus (strain C3-41).
 79318: Protoheme IX farnesyltransferase; Thermus thermophilus (strain ATCC BAA-163 / DSM 7039 / HB27).
```

The user interface provides display of the source swiss-prot files, and the alignment of the two proteins.
