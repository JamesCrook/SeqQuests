# dev/ Directory

The dev/ directory is used for code that is just for developers, including AI assitants. It has python versions of C code. Often the python version was created before the optimised C code, and is deprecated now that the C code is available. However the python can still be useful for testing and debugging, providing a reference implementation.

The dev/ directory is also used for some development notes/logs which are additional to the development tracking in git.
