# New Widgets

SeqQuest uses new graphical UI ideas.

* LCARs user interface with buttons around a central panel.
* Multiscrollers for large lists and trees
* Stream-Graph composition graphs for proteins.

The UI thinking originates with an ambitious project to unify many different kinds of chart and graph. For example bar charts, stream graphs and Sankey diagrams can all be seen as 'examples of the same thing' and they can morph smoothly into each other. SeqQuest is applying these ideas for some real world uses. The bioinformatics actually needs to handle large lists and trees, and the ideas from the widget unification project get tested with real applications.
