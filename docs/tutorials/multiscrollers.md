# Multiscrollers

This is a placeholder for a tutorial on how to use multiscrollers for navigating large quantities of information. It should walk through using the hits multiscroller, and then the tree multiscroller.

> In a multiscroller two or more lists are connected through scrolling. If you drag an item in one list up and down, the other lists will scroll up and down too, to 'keep things in sync'. This is particularly useful for various kinds of index. You can for example click on a protein in one list and see details of it in another.
